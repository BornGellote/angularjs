                <h2><strong>Why Should You Use AngularJS?</strong></h2>
                <p>Most frameworks implement MVC by asking you to split your app into MVC components, then require you to write code to string them up together again. That’s a lot of work. Angular implements MVC by asking you to split your app into MVC components, then just let Angular do the rest. Angular manages your components for you and also serves as the pipeline that connects them.

                    Because Angular acts as the mediator, developers also won’t feel tempted to write shortcuts between components that break abstractions just to make them fit easier.</p>
                <p>Angular uses HTML to define the app’s user interface. HTML is a declarative language which is more intuitive and less convoluted than defining the interface procedurally in JavaScript. HTML is also less brittle to reorganize than an interface written in JavaScript, meaning things are less likely to break. Plus you can bring in many more UI developers when the view is written in HTML.

                    HTML is also used to determine the execution of the app. Special attributes in the HTML determine which controllers to use for each element. These attributes determine “what” gets loaded, but not “how”. This declarative approach greatly simplifies app development in a sort of WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) way. Rather than spending time on how the program flows and what should get loaded first, you simply define what you want and Angular will take care of the dependencies.</p>
